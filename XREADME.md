# Restaurant SPA

Welcome to **FoodMAN Restaurant SPA**! This is a single-page web application (SPA) that allows users to log in, add food items, view the details of food items added by other users, update their own items, and manage their orders. Users can also delete their own orders but cannot buy their own food items.

This project uses **Express** for the backend and **ReactJS** for the frontend. It is designed to provide a smooth user experience and a modern interface with real-time interaction.
